NAME
    Class::DBI::Plugin::RetrieveAll - more complex retrieve_all() for
    Class::DBI

SYNOPSIS
            use base 'Class::DBI';
            use Class::DBI::Plugin::RetrieveAll;

            my @by_date = My::Class->retrieve_all_sorted_by("date");

            # or

            __PACKAGE__->retrieve_all_sort_field('date');

            my @by_date = My::Class->retrieve_all;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple plugin to a Class::DBI subclass that allows for simple
    sorting of the results of a retrieve_all().

    There are two main ways to use this.

    Firstly, we create a new method 'retrieve_all_sorted_by' which takes an
    argument of how to sort.

    We also add a method for 'retrieve_all_sort_field' that sets a default
    field that any retrieve_all() will use for sorting.

METHODS
  retrieve_all_sorted_by
            my @by_date = My::Class->retrieve_all_sorted_by("date");

    This method will be exported into the calling class, and allows for
    retrieving all the objects of the class, sorted by the given column.

    The argument given will be passed straight through to the database 'as
    is', and is not checked in any way, so an error here will usually in an
    error from the database, rather than Class::DBI itself.

    This makes it possible to pass more complex ORDER BY clauses through:

            my @by_date = My::Class->retrieve_all_sorted_by("date DESC, reference_no");

  retrieve_all_sort_field
      __PACKAGE__->retrieve_all_sort_field('date');

    This method changes the default retrieve_all() in the Class to be
    auto-sorted by the field given. Again this will be passed through
    directly, so you can have complex ORDER BY clauses.
